# instaCompetitionBot
Want to participate in those Instagram competitions, but it's not worth your time? Now you can! The instaCompetitionBot enters you into any contest it can find! Both via tag searches and crawling from linked users to linked users! 

This developed out of a 4h coding challenge and was added upon sporadically over the course of two months. 
I've won countless items ranging from fidget spinners, to festival tickets, to bar tab giftcards, to a $500 gift basket full of hair care products! I do not have time to bring it to the next level, but please enjoy getting free gifts delivered to your door! 
It was a fun learning experience for me, maybe one of you wants to continue the project so here it is open to all on github!

Let me know if you find it useful!


Best,
RCCG
